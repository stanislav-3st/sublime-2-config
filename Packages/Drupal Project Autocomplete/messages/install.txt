Usage instructions:

For this plugin to provide autocompletions for your Drupal project you must have an ST2 project file saved in the root of the Drupal project.

To do this open your Drupal files (drag and drop the whole directory onto Sublime Text 2) and then save a new project by using the Project menu item. Make sure you save it in the Drupal root (where the index.php and CHANGELOG.txt files are) and call it whatever you want.

If you are using a VCS like git you will want to exclude this plugin's autocompletions file. If you are using git you can add something like the following line to your gitignore file:

*.sublime-projectcompletions

Sublime CTagsPHP Changelog
==========================

New in 1.1
----------

The initial "import_namespace" assume that your namespace all start from the
first capitalized. You can now change this behavior by creating a
CTagsPHP.sublime-settings in your user directory and set the
"start_dir_pattern" setting to your your need.

For example with Symfony 2, I have set :
{
    "start_dir_pattern": ".*(?:src|vendor)/(.*)"
}

Thanks for installing SublimeCTags for PHP !

You've just added two AWESOME features :

import_use
----------

The first one is 'import use statement'. Just bring your cursor hover
a class name, hit the F5 key (default but customizable) and that's it.

If it does not work, rebuild your .ctags files with the dedicated command.

import_namespace
----------------

Just hit the F4 key, it will add the namespace definition based on the absolute
filename of the current file.

The default setting assume your namespaces all start from the first capitalized
folder. You can change that pattern by creating a CTagsPHP.sublime-settings in
your user directory and changing the "start_dir_pattern" setting.
